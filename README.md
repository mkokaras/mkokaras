 ### 🙌About Me

I am Menelaos Kokaras, I am a **Full Stack Developer** with a BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Thessaly.

🔭 I’m currently working on [Creative Technology Learning Labs](https://ctll.e-ce.uth.gr/) as a Full Stack Developer (using Angular,Node,Express,SQL and Docker).

👨‍💻 Throughout my studies, I've used multiple languages and frameworks such as **C, C++, Java, JavaScript, React, AngularJs, NodeJs, ExpressJS, Django, SQL** and **Mongo**. I am currently trying to master the fundamentals of web developing and exploring the best coding practices and the modern web developing tools.

📝For my undergraduate thesis, I developed an [Anonymous Auction Protocol](https://github.com/mkokaras/anon-zether-auction) based on the Ethereum Blockchain using various cryptographic primitives, developed in NodeJs and Solidity.
